# EcoSLIM_CONUS
## We are doing super cool stuff!
A parallel version EcoSLIM based on domain decomposition and particle transfer using the latest multi-GPU with CUDA-Aware MPI technique. 
The purpose of this development is to handle the particle tracking at the continental US scale with long timescale.
It can be applied to real cases now. Optimization continues.  
Welcome download and use. Enjoy!
