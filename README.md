# EcoSLIM_CONUS
## We are doing super cool stuff!
* A parallel version EcoSLIM based on domain decomposition using the latest multi-GPU with CUDA-aware MPI technique. 
* Halo cells are used around each subdomain to store particles out of boundary and then transfer these particles. 
* The purpose of this development is to handle the particle tracking at the continental US scale with long timescale.
* It can be applied to real cases now. Optimization continues.  
* Welcome download and use. Enjoy!
